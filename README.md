# CS431_Project
Website for game theory and human interaction.
This website was created using REACT v6. The files uploaded are those that were edited in order to create the project. It requires other files such as react-s3 in order to function.
Website designed to run at /vspak22/build as the base.
Can play two games: A dictator game and blackjack; data is collected into a csv file and uploaded to an Amazon s3 database.
Actual website uses a more polished "build" that is created through react.
